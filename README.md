"#TCSS-305-Final" 
Final project for TCSS 305 Programming Practicum, a course designed on providing students with skills in building better java documentation, code design, and GUI elemenets without java window builder. This project was designed to accomadate almost all previous learned skills, the one missed was JUnit testing. This project required students to a build a MS paint like program with more limited functionallity. I recieved a 105% on the assingment, I believe my documentation skills, design concerning inhertance, and building GUI displays skills have all improved. If I redid this assignment I would make sure to build a flow chart or some other paper and pencil representation of the different classes needed, and their interactions prior to initiating coding.
